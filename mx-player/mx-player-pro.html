            <p>
                Currently, applications for watching movies, watching videos are very popular. On PC, I can mention some as Media Player Classic, VLC Media Player and Splash. For mobile, you can try KM Player and Vidmate. Each application has its own advantages and weaknesses. For example, Splash (by Mirillis) has an outstanding advantage which is support for watching movies with 60 FPS frames and easy-to-use interface. However, MX Player Pro also has advantages that other applications don’t. So what are the advantages? Let me go to find out the details. <br><br>
